# Provincial

Provincial is a province based geopolitical simulation in the vein of
Europa Universalis, Civilization, or Victoria. The main innovation which
it adds is the notion of population age demographics, which will allow
more advanced societies to support larger and older populations, which
will provide specialized bonuses to business, trade, and warfare.
